### My Ray Casting Tutorial

Goals :

*   This is a ray casting tutorial.
*   The goal is to understand what is "ray casting" along with some piece of code (HTM5/Java Script).
*   Latter, we want to use this technique to render a work site or a school.
*   This tutorial serves as a basis for student projects.

Ray-casting is a pseudo 3-dimensional rendering technique that are very popular in game development arena in the 90s. Although ray-casting has been supplanted by newer and more powerful techniques (and hardware!), the reader can hopefully still benefit from the technique. Ray-casting sensation began with the release of a game, Wolfenstein 3D (iD Software), in 1992\. In Wolfenstein 3D, the player is placed on a three dimensional maze-like environment, where he/she must find an exit while battling multiple opponents. Wolfenstein 3D becomes an instant classic for its fast and smooth animation. What enables this kind of animation is an innovative approach to three dimensional rendering known as “ray-casting.” Wolfenstein 3D was developed and created by Id Software. Henceforth, Id’s programmer, John Carmack, might well be the person who initiates the ray-casting sensation.

Ray-casting is a technique that transform a limited form of data (a very simplified map or floor plan) into a 3D projection by tracing rays from the view point into the viewing volume.
